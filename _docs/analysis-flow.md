## Overview

The MDI manages data analysis flow in two distinct steps with 
very different handling, as depicted below.

The critical distinctions between Stage 1 Pipelines and Stage 2
Apps are enumerated below. Users and developers may be interested in 
working with either or both stages depending on their needs.

## Stage 1: HPC Pipelines

We use 'pipeline' synonymously with 'workflow' to refer to a series of analysis 
actions coordinated by scripts. Stage 1 pipelines are generally:

- sample autonomous, i.e., they are executed "per sample"
- executed only once on an input data set, not iteratively
- executed the same way on every sample, regardless of the experiment
- hands-off, i.e. not interactive
- resource intensive, in storage and/or CPU needs
- executed on a high-performance compute (HPC) cluster
- dependent on large input data files
- capable of producing small output data files suitable for Stage 2 apps

Although the above properties are not hard-and-fast rules, they collectively make Stage 1 pipelines well suited to being run by a core facility or data producer according to agreed upon best practices. They are also ideal for a cluster server, which the 'mdi' command line utility helps manage.

Common examples of Stage 1 pipelines are read alignment to a genome, bulk image processing, and training of machine learning algorithms.

The pipelines framework does not encode data analysis pipelines themselves, which are found in other code repositories called 'pipelines suites'. Instead, the pipelines frameworks encodes script utilities that:

- allow simple YAML configuration files to be used to define a pipeline
- wrap pipelines into a friendly command-line executable function
- coordinate pipeline job submission to HPC schedulers

## Stage 2: Visualization Apps

Once data are processed in initial steps, Stage 2 applications, or "apps",
support interactive graphical data visualization characterized by:

- lower resource needs
- execution by end users via a web interface
- iterative execution, with adjustments for hypothesis testing, etc.
- execution per sample set, project, etc. (i.e., multiple samples)
- a need for the userâ€™s detailed knowledge of the project
- common analytical approaches applied to variable study designs
- smaller processed data files as input
- publication-ready images and other files as output

Common examples of Stage 2 apps are R Shiny web tools that make
interactive graphs and tables. Once again, the MDI itself does not
carry the tools themselves, it provides a common web interface
where all MDI apps can be easily loaded.
