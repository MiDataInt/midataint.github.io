## {{page.title}}

We are pleased to list public MDI tool suites registered by 
established code providers. 

Providers, please see 
[these instructions](/mdi-suite-template/docs/suite_sharing.html#add-your-public-tools-to-the-mdi-suite-registry)
for getting your suites listed.

### Security notice
Be advised that people with malicious intent
could include dangerous code in their tool suite, as
with any software they provide to you. 

We perform an initial, basic level of code review for appropriateness,
but cannot deeply audit every tool. Tool suites are maintained by providers,
not the MDI team, and will change over time without our knowledge or approval.

You, the user, are 
responsible for deciding whether to trust the people writing
the tools you use and accept all risks and responsibilities for doing so.

To promote transparency and safety, we only list:

- open-source, publicly accessible tool suites, so you can read the
code you are executing.
- tool suites with publicly identified and verified authors, so you
 know who is responsible for the code you use.
