These pages provide documentation for the MDI project overall.
Links within will lead you to documentation pages for other
specific components of the MDI, e.g., how to get started
writing your own application suites. 

## Guiding Principles

Guiding principles in the development of the MDI are:

- easy, standardized implementation
- simple, effective use of modern development tools
- efficient use of scalable computation resources
- maximum developer flexibility

Our goal is to provide frameworks that help you develop and share
data analysis tools more easily, or to use tools developed by others,
without forcing too many requirements into the process. 

## Portability

As the name implies, the MDI was constructed to help researchers
at the University of Michigan develop and share their work.
A few instructions will be specific to our environment. However,
the MDI frameworks are generic and could easily be adopted by any 
laboratory or organization under the MIT license.

## Basic Training

This documentation assumes a basic familiarity with open source
code development. Please see our **Basic Training** tutorials
in the link below if you need help getting started with Git, R,
Shiny, job schedulers, etc.
